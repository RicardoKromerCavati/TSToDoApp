# Overengineered To Do App (Front-end)

This is the front end of my to do app.

The back end part of the project can be found [here](https://sampleUrl/).

My goal with this whole project was initially to learn a functional language, I’m a C# programmer and right way I thought about **F#**. I started studying the language’s syntax and some functional concepts.

After that I decided to develop something specific but I was having problems trying to find what was the best thing I could do with it.

Then I decided to something I have already done a few times with C#, an API, and specifically with F#, I chose the minimal API to keep it as simple as possible in the beginning of my trail.

When I created the project I realized it didn’t make sense to have an API without a client to consume it, and that’s where the **TypeScript** comes in.

Another thing I know I need to study more is the front end and its orbiting concepts, then I decided to use this opportunity and learn more about it, I chose the **React Framework** because while looking for frameworks I read it was the one with the biggest amount of content online, so it would be easier if I encountered any problems, and I choose TypeScript because I’m used to strongly typed programming languages.

## The Overengineered Part
In my opinion the whole project is a bit overengineered because I believe that an API is not needed to develop a fully working to do app, and it actually depends, but in the end think it was the best title for this project.
